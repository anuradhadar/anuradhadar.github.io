## Anuradha Dar, Principal

Inspired by her school teachers Late Elizabeth Gauba and Late M.N. Kapur, Ms. Dar wanted to establish a nursery that would cater to the physical, psychological and social needs of the child, in the true sense of the term. When Pink ’n’ Blue was born in 1988, its first class consisted of only three children. Under the able guidance of Ms. Dar, the preparatory has served the parents of Mayur Vihar and surrounding areas with utmost dedication. Her commitment and personal involvement has been the hallmark of success of Pink ’n’ Blue Nursery. 

Lately, this alumnus of Modern School, Barakhamba Road was instrumental in reviving one of the Delhi's oldest theatre groups, Three Arts Club, which works for the promotion of art and culture through the media of dance, music and drama. Having grown up amidst rehearsals, the art and culture background helped her develop the passion for theatre along with the emotional bonding that the three arts has for her. A teacher by profession and with teaching experience of more than 3 decades she has contributed significantly to the field of pre-nursery education.
